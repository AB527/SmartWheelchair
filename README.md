### Smart Wheelchair: Multi-controller based Wheelchair Safety using Android, Touch, Speech & Gesture Control

---

**Objective:**
The aim of this project is to design and develop a wheelchair that can be controlled through multiple methods such as an Android app, touch, speech, and gestures. This will enhance user safety and accessibility, making it easier for people with different abilities to operate the wheelchair.

**Work Plan:**

1. **Research and Design**: Study existing control mechanisms and design a wheelchair that integrates Android, touch, speech, and gesture controls.
   
2. **Bluetooth-based Android App Development**: 
   - Develop an Android app that uses Bluetooth to communicate with the wheelchair’s motors. 
   - The app will feature controls for touch, voice commands, and gesture recognition, allowing the user to choose their preferred method of control.

3. **Hardware Setup**: Equip the wheelchair with Bluetooth modules, motor drivers, and sensors to receive commands from the app and other control systems.

4. **Integration**: Ensure all control systems (Android, touch, speech, gesture) work seamlessly together and respond accurately to user inputs.

5. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct trials to test the system’s reliability and safety, fine-tuning the performance for smoother control.

**Expected Outcome:**
A multi-functional, safe wheelchair that can be operated via Bluetooth through an Android app with touch, speech, and gesture controls, offering greater flexibility and ease of use.
